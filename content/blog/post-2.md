      **Hello to all my dear subscribers! For a long time I did not make news
      about my mod. This is related to the job search. Having found the time I
      started doing a media update. Go!**

      To date, the alignment is:


      1 map - the geometry is made on 100%, the map has textures, it is necessary to make scripts, details, models, lighting, sounds. At the moment the map consists of 4572 brushes.


      2 map - the beginning is necessary.


      The screenshots will be mostly from the Hammer due to lack of lighting.


      1 map


      That's all. Because of the work of the time noticeably decreased, but I will continue to make a mod and share news!

      ***Power up + Blast pit = Power pit*** .You need to launch a rocket with a
      satellite. For this, it is necessary to supply fuel, energy, oxygen to the
      rocket. 


      You can launch a missile in the center of missile launch. You can get there only with the help of a scientist. 


      You have to find a scientist and protect from monsters, soldiers and other machine guns. To help you come guard and together fighting off all the enemies and including oxygen and fuel, you must deliver the scientist to the launching center of missiles.
