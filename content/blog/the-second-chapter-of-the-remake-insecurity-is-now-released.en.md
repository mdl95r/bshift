      were working really hard to create it. A lot of scripted scenes, voice
      acting and interactions! Thanks to Kevin Sisk and Michael Hillard from
      Crowbar Collective, we were able to keep the original voices of most of
      the Black Mesa staff! The rest was covered by UnstoppableGiant and bONES!!
      - they did great on Otis and our *totally ~~un~~important* female
      scientist!

      We redid some dialogues in the first chapter, fixed some bugs and extended
      it's ending for a few minutes! Replay it, so you can transition to the
      Insecurity seamlessly, rather than jumping right into it and wondering
      where the hell are you).


      Also the new release includes those features and changes:


      * Chapter 2: Insecurity;

      * Updated Chapter 1: Living Quarters Outbound;

      * Subtitles for English and Russian, so you can read something new while playing;

      * Keyboard/mouse/xbox controller icons in the binding options in the new UI;

      * New default preset for the controller, which you can use by clicking on the new button in the bindings options in the new UI (when applying controller preset, it unbinds all the keyboard bindings for the HUD hints to show up the right icons, and vice versa);

      * Chapter name is now showing up properly instead of a map name in saves;

      * New soundtrack from our great composer, Daver, one of which you can hear down there;

      * You can read the mod description, [developer blog](https://blueshift.hecucollective.com/blog/) and see the people involved in the development of this remake in the last two tabs in the new UI;

      * And more...
