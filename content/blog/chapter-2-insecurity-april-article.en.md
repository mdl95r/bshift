      Development of the second chapter, "Insecurity", is in full swing now.
      Currently we are close to finishing the base geometry. 


      We plan to implement some interactions with the environment and NPCs. Thanks to the help from Crowbar Collective's voice actors, we will now be able to bring a lot of new guard and male scientists lines and scripted scenes!

      We would like to note that in the process of making this chapter we found
      some inconsistencies in location of some places that conflict with the
      Black Mesa locations. 


      In order to fix it, we will try adding some small extentions. Because of that, we would like to hear your opinion on such actions. You can see a screenshot of one of those new places there:

    text: We remind you that with the release of every new chapter we will release
      fixes and changes to previous chapters too, so if there is any criticism
      from you about this, we will always come back and fix everything.

      There are more things in our plans: we want to remake hands viewmodel and
      pistol animation. Menu still needs a lot of things to change(mostly
      visually), and HUD. 


      We also want to release M4 and Beretta models from Azure Sheep separately, as they were requested by a lot of you.
