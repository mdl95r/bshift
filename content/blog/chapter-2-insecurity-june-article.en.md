      We’ve got our HUD in progress now. It’s hard to make it unique while there
      are so many restrictions. HUD in Black Mesa was made solely for the Black
      Mesa, so we can’t do much customization or restore some of the HL2
      features, because they are not working now. It’s impossible to permanently
      disable the scanlines, because this option (that was implemented by
      Crowbar Collective) is broken in BM. It would be great to have it fixed.


      Also, there will be new Glock animations and hands model.
