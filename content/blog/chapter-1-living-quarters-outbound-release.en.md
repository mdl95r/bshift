      *Installation method:*


      If you have downloaded it from the Workshop, the files should be there (near the directory where the game located):
  - type: htmlBlock
    code:
      code: >-
        <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
          <img style="margin: 0 auto;" src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4214/4213492/profile/Screenshot_2021-03-16_110727.png" alt="Directory of the mod" title="Directory of the mod">
        </div>

      1. Download the mod and extract it's files from .zip  *(NO NEED IF YOU
      DOWNLOADED FROM WORKSHOP)* ; \

      2. Move the files into your Black Mesa root directory  *(* \ steamapps \ common \ Black Mesa) *, so*  "bshift"  *folder could be in the same directory as*  "bms" * folder; \

      3. Launch the mod via one of the .bat files ( *bshift.bat*  for the new UI  *(RECOMMENDED)* ,  *bshift_oldUI.bat*  for the old UI  *(NOT YET READY)* ). \
         3-alt. Alternatively you can set Black Mesa launch properties in Steam to "-game bshift" and launch it via Black Mesa Steam shortcut or from Steam itself.

      !!! This mod supports English language only for now, so set you game / Steam to English in order to evade any possible problems !!!
