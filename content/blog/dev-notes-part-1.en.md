      Hello, dear readers! Today we will tell you details of our work on the
      first chapter of the Black Mesa: Blue Shift. We'll start from the very
      beginning.


      It's not a secret to you that for about three years we’ve been working on Azure Sheep remake, which had some similarities with Blue Shift – both had a security guard as the main character and had some similar gameplay features. In the process of development, we often thought of starting work on the Blue Shift remake. But there already were Insecurity and Guard Duty. At the beginning we were not as good in Hammer as we wanted to be, so Azure Sheep was some kind of a playground for us, where we were extending our capabilities, improving our skills, learning new things for the next few years.


      At the end of November 2020, we were close to the release of Azure Sheep: Part One Extended. At the same time we contacted Insecurity developer and were shocked by the sad news – he lost all his files and ceased the development. We wanted to help him with mod development, since we were looking forward to play in this project too, but it was too late. Everything that was left were some screenshots of that mod from 2013-2017.

    text: After that we realized this was a chance to make our own take on the BS
      remake, so small part of the team started working on it. In secret from
      the entire team, which was very tired from AS, development of the first
      map began. BlackPriest was setting up base geometry and some other
      elements while looking at Insecurity maps screenshots. The main objective
      was to show the rest of the team something “real”, good-looking and
      interesting, not involving them in it immediately so they could rest a
      bit.

      At the beginning we just wanted to restore Insecurity mod back to its
      original form, but it was impossible. So from that point we started to
      take some liberties and change things here and there. Over time, we
      improved maps so they looked more modern and refreshed.


      In order to recreate the location, you need to start from somewhere, find the exact dimensions, since in many ways locations used assets from black mesa, sizes were calculated with monorail support pillars. It was good that Insecurity developer used materials from BM – it helped us a lot in creation of the map. 


      The first three weeks of development were preparatory and during that time we made the base monorail path for the tram.

    text: With the first screenshots shown to the rest of the team back in early
      December 2020, and having all the experience and skills gained during
      Azure Sheep development, we continued our work on Blue Shift remake with
      all HECU Collective members involved. We thought of it as of something
      special, so we didn’t make any announcements before the chapter was near
      it’s completion, so you wouldn’t be disappointed if it was cancelled.

    text: Every location should have great geometry and logic, but also it should be
      filled with details, and Faber covered this part just perfectly. We made
      many new models using programs we didn’t work with before.
