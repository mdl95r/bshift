      This is the second part of Black Mesa: Blue Shift development history.


      We can’t just make a mod without some easter eggs. These models show the locations from yet unreleased Azure Sheep: Part Two and abandoned Hope of Rescue, that had been in development in far 2017.

      While we worked on the maps, we started thinking on the name of our
      project. There were some things that we didn’t want to face, such as
      copyright issues or whatever. We thought of a lot different interesting
      options, but we decided to shorten the list to “Long Shift”, “Blue Shift”
      and “Black Mesa: Blue Shift”. If we would call it as the two last options,
      this could have caused a lot of confusion, because there were at least 5
      “Blue Shift” mods on the ModDB, and part of the team wanted to give our
      mod some originality. The other part thought that if we used “Blue Shift”
      in the title, it could get us a lot of attention in short time (and now I
      think they were right). Later, “Long Shift” became a backup title for us.
      In case of any troubles, we were ready to quickly rename the project.

      One of the biggest things happened was Cyvo joining the team. His mapping
      skills are incredible, and we are really honored to have him with us. He’s
      responsible for the key moments in the Extended version of AS: Part One.
      We didn’t know if he’d want to continue working on the new project with
      us, as he was making the sequel to his own mod – Damocles
      (<https://blackmesa-damocles.com/>) – but he agreed to it, and the work
      started going on the full pace.


      Next stop – announcement of the project. In comparison to our previous work, it was incredible We really didn’t expect to see the news about us on sites such as PC Gamer. It was really interesting and great reaction that exceeded all our expectations, and from now on we knew that we did choose the right way, and we can’t let everyone down.


      I hope you were interested in this pile of text and images we posted. We think of continuing this developer blog in the future. Thank you for your attention. See y’all!
