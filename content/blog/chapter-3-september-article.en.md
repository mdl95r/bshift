      After the release of the "Insecurity" chapter, Skyms2663 (creator of the
      Black Mesa: Insecurity) contacted our team and gave us his restored map
      sources, which made development of the third chapter much easier. Our
      level designers used these sources as a base for our maps. Some places are
      even being slightly improved without major changes.


      While part of the team was still working on the second chapter, a separate part of it was busy by making "Duty Calls". Geometry and base design for the locations are mostly done, and next things to do will be more detailed visuals pass, adding gameplay and optimizing the maps.


      It's no secret that in the original Blue Shift, the entire chapter took a maximum of 15-20 minutes to complete. Location designs changed too quickly and that time was not enough to get in the atmosphere of different zones. So, in order to fix that, we will expand this chapter too. There will be some small additions, and maybe some new places where player could walk on, adding more time to spend there.

    text: The new academic year has started and therefore free time has decreased
      for some of our team. the development may be longer than we wanted. We
      think we can finish everything by the end of october, but that's just
      some ~~dark magic~~ predictions that shouldn't be taken as the real
      release timing.
