          Initially developed and released by Gearbox Software in 2001,
          second Half-Life add-on, Half-Life: Blue Shift is a return to the
          Black Mesa Research Facility and another look at the Incident's
          consequences from the eyes of Gordon Freeman's best friend - Barney
          Calhoun


          In 2012, Crowbar Collective has delighted Half-Life fans with release of the magnificent Half-Life remake, but there are still no released remakes for add-ons. This is when we are coming in - HECU Collective are developing the Black Mesa: Blue Shift - a free remake with use of Black Mesa resources and style. We will try to stay as close to the original Blue Shift and Black Mesa as possible. Our mod will be releasing partially, chapter by chapter, so those who are not patient for the full release will finally have something to play!

          The team was founded on December 10, 2016. April 2018, the AS team
          joined the main development team, thereby forming
          the **HECU Collective**.


          At the same time, we do not limit ourselves to the framework and can post both a trailer for a new game/mod on the Source engine, and interesting news from the world of half-life and other games from Valve.

          ## The Page dot.


          The root context, the one available to you in your `baseof.html` and layouts will always be the Page context. Basically everything you need to build this page is in that dot.\

          `.Title`, `.Permalink`, `.Resources`, you name it.


          Even your site’s informations is stored in the page context with `.Site` ready for the taking.


          But in Go Template the minute you step into a function you lose that context as your precious dot or context is replaced by the function’s own… dot.


          Let’s dive into a template file!

          It will be 2 years soon. During this time, there were ups and downs of
          the modification. But is it otherwise development has been and is
          going on now. In addition, one good section of the mod helped me make
          my good friend.Now we turn specifically to the modification. During
          the optimization, it was decided to abandon some locations and thus
          there will be only 3 maps - a, b, c, but the mod will be quite large,
          with rich gameplay.


          At the moment, the availability of the maps is as follows:


          * A - 90%

          * B - 80%

          * C - 60%


          My mistake was on moddb to set the release date for the 4th quarter of 2019. Obviously, development will flow into 2020. So, while the status is “To be announced”


          I want to show screenshots of their Hammer’a, while there is no way to get a good picture. But testing passes, albeit without light with fullbright’s))
